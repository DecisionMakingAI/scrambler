# Enhancements

To make the car easier to use and facilitate training, a few enhancements were added to the basic car.

* The power switch for the ESC is buried in the middle of the car, so a power switch was added to the side of the car.
* To monitor the state of the car battery, a mini-panel voltmeter was added.
* When running off the battery, only reduced power is available for the Jetson Nano. A separate LiPo battery along with a power regulator was added so the processor can be run at full power.
* Swapped the NiMH battery for a LiPo for longer run times. This battery was slightly bigger so the battery holder needed adjusting.


These issues can all be addressed by redesigning the 3D printed material to accomodate appropriate battery holders and a power panels for controlling and monitoring battery levels.
